Flags importantes
-write_coco_json (Full file path to write people pose data with JSON COCO
      validation format. If foot, face, hands, etc. JSON is also desired
      (--write_coco_json_variants), they are saved with different file name
      suffix.) type: string default: ""

-number_people_max (This parameter will limit the maximum number of people
      detected, by keeping the people with top scores. The score is based in
      person area over the image, body part score, as well as joint score
      (between each pair of connected body parts). Useful if you know the exact
      number of people in the scene, so it can remove false positives (if all
      the people have been detected. However, it might also include false
      negatives by removing very small or highly occluded people. -1 will keep
      them all.) type: int32 default: -1

-tracking (Experimental, not available yet. Whether to enable people
      tracking across frames. The value indicates the number of frames where
      tracking is run between each OpenPose keypoint detection. Select -1
      (default) to disable it or 0 to run simultaneously OpenPose keypoint
      detector and tracking for potentially higher accurary than only
      OpenPose.) type: int32 default: -1
